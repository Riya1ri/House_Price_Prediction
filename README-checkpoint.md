# Predicting House Prices Using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor

This project focuses on predicting house prices using two powerful machine learning models: Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor. By analyzing various features of the houses, such as size, location, and number of rooms, the models aim to provide accurate price predictions. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to compare the performance of these algorithms. The goal is to develop a reliable prediction system that can assist in making informed real estate decisions.
